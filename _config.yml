    Hi, My name is Jake Pulitzer. I am a motivated and hard working Marketing Analyst hoping to make a positive impact in the clean tech and sustainable energy sectors. Specializing in customer-facing products and programs powered by AMI technology (smart meters), I work on a start-up like team that uses Agile and Lean business management methodologies to drive continuous improvement. I excel at building relationships with internal and external stakeholders, leading the development of complex marketing campaigns in Salesforce, and monitoring customer behavior and engagement data. My problem-solving mindset drives me to analyze program performance, identify key areas to improve customer experience, and make process improvement recommendations to management. With a Master's in Business Analytics and a Bachelor's in Strategic Communications from the University of Colorado Boulder, I stay up-to-date on the latest tech, marketing, and CX trends in the utility industry and clean tech sector. Outside of work, I am an aspiring entrepreneur, outdoor enthusiast, and am always ready to take on challenges and dive into innovative solutions.
